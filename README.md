## Tech

Encrypt App uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- ReactJS - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- Firebase - awesome platform from google.
- AWS EC2 & emailing service - services from the cloud based platform we all know and love.
- AES 256-bit encryption - for the safest possible encryption.
- Steganography - since we have to hide our password while it's being transfered!
